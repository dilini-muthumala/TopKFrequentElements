# Top K Frequent Elements (Java)

This project implements a Java function to return the top **K most frequent** integers from a given array using a performance-optimized approach (HashMap + MinHeap). It also includes JUnit 5 test cases covering normal and edge scenarios.

Although the same function can be written in Java 8 Streams (which will be more readable and concise), it was not done that way due to concerns on time complexity and scalability.
